Q1:
"""
Write a Python program that acts like a Math Quiz Game.
 The program should display a menu of different math challenges,
 ask the user a question, get their answer, and then tell them if their answer is correct or not.
The menu should be:
1. Addition Challenge
2. Subtraction Challenge
3. Multiplication Challenge
4. Division Challenge
5. Number Comparison
6. Exit

Your program should:
Display the menu once.


Ask the user to pick a challenge (1–6).


Take the required inputs (numbers).


Ask the user for their answer to a math problem.


Check if it’s correct or wrong, then display a message.





Q2:
"""
Create a Python program that acts as a Math Puzzle Builder.
The program should:
Present 3–4 different math puzzles (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or comparing numbers).


Ask the user to answer each puzzle.


Keep track of correct answers and calculate a score at the end.


Display a final message based on the score.



Q3:

"""
Write a Python program that displays a menu of math operations.
 The program should perform basic calculations and number-based tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
 squares, cubes, etc.
Your program should:
Display the following menu once:

1. Basic Arithmetic (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
2. Square and Cube of a Number
3. Check if a Number is Even or Odd
4. Find the Greater of Two Numbers
5. Find the Area of Basic Shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle)
6. Exit


Ask the user for their choice (1–6).


Take the required inputs and perform the calculation.


Display clear, labeled results.


Do not use loops (run once and exit).

Q4:

"""
"Identify the Type of Triangle using Python"
📝 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determines:
Whether the given sides can form a valid triangle or not.


If valid, determine whether the triangle is:


Equilateral (all sides equal)


Isosceles (two sides equal)


Scalene (all sides different)


📘 Conditions to Remember:
A triangle is valid only if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
 That is:
(a + b) > c
(a + c) > b
(b + c) > a

💡 Hints:
Take inputs for the three sides.


First, check if the triangle is valid.


If valid, use conditional statements to identify its type.


Display appropriate messages for each case.


📤 Expected Output Example:
Enter side a: 5
Enter side b: 5
Enter side c: 8

These sides can form a triangle.
Type: Isosceles Triangle
